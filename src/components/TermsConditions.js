            Clients have the option to choose between a 50% downpayment or full
            upfront payment once the sketch is approved. Please note that
            refunds or cancellations are not permitted after payment has been
            made. The turnaround time for completing artwork is dependent on the
            complexity of the requested art, and pricing may vary accordingly.
            The finished artwork will be delivered via email. Additional charges
            apply for extra characters at $5 or Php 250, while flat backgrounds
            are provided free of charge, with a $3 fee for detailed backgrounds.
            To ensure a smooth process, it's essential to read and comprehend
            these terms of service. Begin by contacting us via Twitter,
            Facebook, or Instagram, and provide clear references along with a
            detailed description of your request. Upon confirmation of all
            details, you can proceed with either an upfront payment or a 50%
            downpayment of the total price. We will commence work upon payment
            receipt. Prior to coloring, rough sketches will be submitted for
            your approval, with only one revision permitted. We will keep you
            informed with periodic updates on the progress of your commission.
            Once the commission is finalized, a PNG file will be sent to you via
            email.
